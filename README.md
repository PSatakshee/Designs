### My Designs

1. **Coding Club Website Design**  
   As the lead designer for my BCA Coding Club, I spearheaded the creation of a dynamic website that serves as a hub for coding enthusiasts. I also worked with the talented team on few more other designing content, ensuring that the design was visually appealing.

2. **Ladder Website and Logo Design**  
   For my project "Ladder," I designed both the website and the logo from scratch. The website is clean, intuitive, and structured to guide users smoothly through the platform. The logo embodies growth and progress, complementing the projectâ€™s mission.
